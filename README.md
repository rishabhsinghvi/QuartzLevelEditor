# QuartzLevelEditor
Level Editor for tile-based 2D games using SFML and ImGui

I started this project as a way to quickly develop and export levels for my 2D platformer Quartz. The Quartz Level Creator exports a JSON file containing tile map information, entity information and other required data, which is then parsed during run time to load levels.

### Features:


- Ability to create new textures
- Animation
- Entity Creation
- [TODO] Tile Map Creation
